ASSIGNMENT 1 : Create a Product Carousel for Featured Products

The code imports a pre-built component called Carousel from the React-Bootstrap library.
The component is used to create an image carousel, which is a great way to display multiple images in a small space on a website.
The component is styled using a locally sourced CSS file.

In this code block, the "indicators" prop has been set to false. 
This means that the dots that usually appear at the bottom of the carousel slides to show which slide you're on will be hidden.

These images will rotate automatically or can be scrolled through manually using the arrow buttons at either end of the carousel.

The code uses React, a popular JavaScript library, and the React-Bootstrap library, which provides pre-built components that work well with React.
This saves time and effort by allowing developers to focus on the functionality of their code rather than the nitty-gritty of writing CSS. 

Therefore, this code follows a best practice of using pre-built and well-tested components to speed up development and ensure code reliability.
