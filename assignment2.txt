ASSIGNMENT 2 : Develop a Customizable Product Bundle for Chocolate brand

The overall goal of this code is to create a simple web page that allows the user to purchase custom chocolates, with options for different flavors and quantities.

This functional component renders a list of chocolate cards.
It maintains state â€“ the number of items, the number of dark, brown and white chocolates, and the total cost.
It also has two helper functions that increment or decrement the number of items and chocolates. 

The component uses the useEffect hook to update the total cost whenever any of the chocolate counts change.
The chocolate information is stored in an array of objects.Each object contains the respective state variables and setters.
The ButtonFunction component receives the state variables and setters as props and renders the increment and decrement buttons. 

There are no external tools or frameworks used in this component. The component uses React and its built-in hooks and functions to handle state and rendering the UI.
